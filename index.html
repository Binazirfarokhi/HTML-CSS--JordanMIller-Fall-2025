                <div class="description">
                    <p> A game is a structured type of play usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or video games) or art (such as games involving an artistic layout such as mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). </p>

                <div class="description">
                     <p>All games must have a challenge and a structure; barring certain exceptions like sandbox games, all games also have an objective. Multiplayer games also include interaction between two or more players. Not all forms of play are considered games; toys and puzzles, for instance, are not games, as they do not have a structure. </p>

                     <p>Games generally involve either mental stimulation, physical stimulation, or both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role. </p>

                <h3>Tools</h3>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e.g., miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer). In places where the use of leather is well-established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history.</p>
