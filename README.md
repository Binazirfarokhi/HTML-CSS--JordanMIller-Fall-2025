I recommend that you at least skim through the two videos Introduction to CSS Grid Parts 1 and 2, as they cover basic concepts that you will be expected to be familiar with. If these ideas are new to you, you should watch the videos carefully and follow along with the demos.
The slides Introduction to Grid cover much of the same ground as the above videos, but may be helpful as a reference.
Watch the videos (and complete the demos therein) Intrinsic Design with CSS Grid and Grid Template Areas. Please watch these videos before our lab this week, as you'll be required to know these topics to follow along. 
Complete the tutorial Advanced CSS Grid Techniques;
The optional video by Jen Simmons may seem a bit out of date (as it's from 2018), but it's interesting and gives some insight into the inception of the Intrinsic Design idea and the historical development of some other familiar web design ideas.
Complete this week's assignment;
Review this week's discussion questions.
