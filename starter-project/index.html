                Andor, also known as Star Wars: Andor or Andor: A Star Wars Story for its second season, is an American science fiction political spy thriller drama television series created by Tony Gilroy for the streaming service Disney+. It is part of the Star Wars franchise and a prequel to the film Rogue One (2016), which itself is a prequel to the original Star Wars film (1977). The series follows thief-turned-rebel spy Cassian Andor during the five formative years leading up to the events of the two films, exploring how he becomes radicalized against the Galactic Empire and how the wider Rebel Alliance is formed.
